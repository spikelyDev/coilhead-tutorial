# Coilhead from Lethal Company - Unity Project

This Unity project is based on the code featured in my YouTube video tutorial on how to code Coilhead, a character from the game Lethal Company. This project demonstrates the implementation of Coilhead's mechanics and behavior in Unity, providing a foundation for creating similar AI-driven characters.
